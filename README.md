# TwoFish-project
A word-learning game


An app(game), in which the kids should guess a picture by a written word. The database for the app must be inserted from the teacher. There must be several wrong answers and just one right. If the kid chooses the right picture, a key, hanging from a barrel, should go downwards. Else it should go upwards. When the amount of needed right answers is achieved, the key should be low enough to open a container.
